      <p>
        Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity because they offer several advantages over traditional fiat currencies, such as lower
        transaction fees, faster transaction times, and greater security. They also offer greater privacy and anonymity for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrency, or "crypto" for short, is a type of digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation
        of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and operate independently of central
        banks or governments.
